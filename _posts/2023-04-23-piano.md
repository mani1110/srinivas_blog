3. Practice regularly: Like any skill, playing the piano requires practice. Set aside time each day to practice, even if it's just for a few minutes. Consistent practice will help you develop muscle memory and improve your playing.

4. Learn the basics: Start by learning the basics of music theory and piano technique. This includes learning how to read sheet music, understanding rhythm and timing, and practicing scales and arpeggios.
