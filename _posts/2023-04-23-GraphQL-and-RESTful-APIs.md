APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, have become a crucial part of modern software development. They allow different services and applications to communicate with each other seamlessly. Two popular types of APIs that developers use are RESTful APIs and GraphQL APIs. In this blog, we will look at the differences between these two types of APIs and explore when to use them.

RESTful APIs

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. RESTful APIs are a standard way to expose data and functionality over the internet. They rely on HTTP requests to transfer data between client and server. The most common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods are used to retrieve, create, update, and delete resources, respectively.

RESTful APIs follow a strict request-response model. This means that every request sent to the server must include all the necessary information for the server to complete the request. This information is usually included in the URL, query parameters, or the request body.

RESTful APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning that the server does not store any client state. This makes RESTful APIs simple and easy to scale. However, it also means that every request must include all the necessary information, even if it has been sent before.

GraphQL APIs

GraphQL is a newer API technology that was developed by Facebook. GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to specify exactly what data they need from the server. This means that clients can get all the data they need in a single request, rather than making multiple requests for different resources.

GraphQL APIs use a single endpoint to handle all requests. This endpoint accepts GraphQL queries, which describe the data that the client needs. The server then returns a JSON response containing only the requested data.

One of the main benefits of GraphQL is that it allows clients to get the exact data they need, without over-fetching or under-fetching data. This can improve the performance of the application by reducing the amount of data transferred over the network.

When to use RESTful APIs

RESTful APIs are ideal when you need to expose a large number of resources over the internet. RESTful APIs are simple to design and implement, and they are supported by almost all programming languages and frameworks.

RESTful APIs are also a good choice when you need to expose your API to third-party developers. Since RESTful APIs follow a strict request-response model, it is easy for developers to understand how to use them.

When to use GraphQL APIs

GraphQL APIs are a good choice when you need to fetch complex, hierarchical data. With GraphQL, clients can specify exactly what data they need, rather than relying on the server to return all the data in a resource. This can improve the performance of the application by reducing the amount of data transferred over the network.

GraphQL APIs are also a good choice when you need to expose your API to internal developers only. Since GraphQL APIs require a specific set of tools and libraries to use, they are best suited for internal use.

Conclusion

Both RESTful APIs and GraphQL APIs have their strengths and weaknesses. RESTful APIs are simple to design and implement, and they are supported by almost all programming languages and frameworks. GraphQL APIs allow clients to get the exact data they need, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network.

When deciding which API to use, consider the complexity of the data you need to expose, as well as who will be using the API. RESTful APIs are a good choice when you need to expose a large number of resources over the internet or need to expose your API to third-party developers. GraphQL APIs are a good choice when you need to fetch complex, hierarchical data or need to expose your API to internal developers only.
