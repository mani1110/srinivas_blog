Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) are two approaches to generating HTML pages for web applications. While traditional client-side rendering (CSR) relies on JavaScript to generate HTML on the client side, SSR and SSG take a different approach.

Server-side rendering is the process of generating HTML on the server and sending it to the client as a complete HTML page. This approach is commonly used in server-side web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Django, and Express.js. With SSR, the server generates the initial HTML page and sends it to the client, along with the JavaScript code needed to render the dynamic content. Once the JavaScript is executed on the client side, it can take over and continue to update the page as necessary.

SSR has several benefits over CSR. For one, it can improve the performance of web applications by reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and executed on the client side. This can lead to faster initial load times and a better user experience. Additionally, SSR can improve the SEO of web applications by providing search engines with a complete HTML page to crawl, rather than relying on JavaScript to generate the page content.

Static site generation is another approach to generating HTML pages for web applications. With SSG, the HTML pages are generated ahead of time and served as static files. This approach is commonly used in static site generators such as Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby. SSG works by generating the HTML pages at build time, using data from various sources such as Markdown files, YAML files, or APIs. The resulting HTML pages are then served to the client as static files, without the need for a server-side rendering engine.

SSG has several benefits over both SSR and CSR. For one, it can provide even faster initial load times, since the HTML pages are already generated and do not require any additional processing on the server or client side. Additionally, SSG can reduce the overall complexity of web applications by eliminating the need for server-side rendering and reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be written.

In conclusion, server-side rendering and static site generation are two approaches to generating HTML pages for web applications. While SSR is commonly used in server-side web frameworks, SSG is commonly used in static site generators. Both approaches can provide benefits such as improved performance and SEO, but the choice between them depends on the specific needs of the web application.
